Simple Calculator in C++
This repository contains a simple calculator application written in C++ as part of a GitHub internship program. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To get started with the project, first, clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/username/simple-calculator.git, and then navigate to the project directory with cd simple-calculator. You can compile the program using g++ with the command g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator, which will create an executable file named calculator. Once compiled, you can run the calculator by executing ./calculator in your terminal. The program will prompt you to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /), and it will display the result of the operation. For example, entering 10, +, and 5 will yield the result 10 + 5 = 15. The project is open to contributions, so if you have suggestions for improvements or additional features, please feel free to fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request.
